This is a regular home page with added keyboard shortcut functionalities that can be modified to anyone's liking.

# how to use :
There is a [list of hotkeys](https://akham.netlify.app/hotkeys.html)
You can checkout.

# how do I modify the page:

First run the following command on your terminal
 **on windows you will have to install git**
`git clone https://github.com/silentne1gma/home.git`
This will clone the repo to your local machine
With whatever text editor you like open index.html
Modify the `<a>` tag
*For example*
`<a href="your link">name of site<a>`

# how to add keyboard shortcuts :
Go to the js/ directory and modify the *hotkeys.js*
in the `sites` dictionary add `"key":"site"`
If you're adding multipule site make sure to add *,* between them or else it won't work
